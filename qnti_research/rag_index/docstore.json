"metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Federal bank regulatory agencies seek further comment on interagency effort to reduce regulatory burden\n\nHere is a concise summary of the research document:\n\n**Key Market Implications:**\n\nThe Federal Reserve's interagency effort to reduce regulatory burden may lead to increased economic activity and job creation, potentially boosting market sentiment.\n\n**Trading/Investment Insights:**\n\nThis development could lead to a shift in investor appetite towards riskier assets, such as equities or high-yield bonds, as the reduced regulatory burden increases confidence in the economy. Conversely, it may also lead to a flight to quality, driving demand for safe-haven assets like U.S. Treasuries.\n\n**Economic Indicators Mentioned:**\n\nThe document does not explicitly mention specific economic indicators, but the overall tone suggests that the Federal Reserve is seeking to promote economic growth and job creation.\n\n**Risk Factors or Opportunities:**\n\nThe reduced regulatory burden may increase the risk of financial instability if banks take on excessive risk. On the other hand, it could also lead to increased lending and investment, driving economic growth and job creation. Investors should carefully monitor the impact of these changes on market sentiment and asset prices.\n\nOverall, this development has the potential to influence market trends and investor behavior, making it an important consideration for traders and investors.\n\n\ufeff\nFederal Reserve Board - Federal bank regulatory agencies seek further comment on interagency effort to reduce regulatory burden\nSkip to main content\nAn official website of the United States GovernmentHere's how you knowOfficial websites use .govA .gov website belongs to an official government organization in the United States.Secure .gov websites use HTTPSA lock (LockLocked padlock icon) or https:// means you've safely connected to the .gov website.

Corporation\nFederal Reserve Board\nOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency\nFor release at 4:00 p.m. EDT\nShare\nThe federal bank regulatory agencies today announced their fourth notice requesting public comment to reduce regulatory burden. The Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act requires the agencies to review their regulations at least once every 10 years to identify outdated, unnecessary, or unduly burdensome regulatory requirements for their supervised institutions.\nTo facilitate this review, the agencies divided their regulations into 12 categories and are now soliciting comments on their regulations for the three remaining categories: Banking Operations, Capital, and the Community Reinvestment Act. The public has 90 days from publication in the Federal Register to comment on the relevant regulations.\nThe agencies will hold outreach meetings where interested parties may comment on applicable regulatory requirements directly to the agencies. Information about the outreach meetings will be publicized as details are finalized.\nFederal Register notice:\u00a0Regulatory Publication and Review Under the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act of 1996 (PDF)\nEconomic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act (EGRPRA) website\nMedia Contacts:\nFDIC\nCarroll Kim\n(202) 898-7389\nFRB\nChelsea Grate\n(202) 452-2955\nOCC\nAndrea Cox\n(202) 649-6870\nRelated Content\nBoard Votes\nLast Update:\nJuly 21, 2025\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nAbout the FedNews & EventsMonetary PolicySupervision & RegulationFinancial StabilityPayment SystemsEconomic ResearchDataConsumers & CommunitiesConnect with the Board\nTools and Information\nContact\nPublications\nFreedom of Information (FOIA)\nOffice of Inspector General\nBudget & Performance | Audit\nNo FEAR Act\nEspa\u00f1ol\nWebsite Policies\n| Privacy Program\nAccessibility\nStay Connected\nFederal Reserve Facebook Page\nFederal Reserve Instagram Page\nFederal Reserve YouTube Page\nFederal Reserve Flickr Page\nFederal Reserve LinkedIn Page\nFederal Reserve Threads Page\nLink to Federal Reserve X Page\nLink to Federal Reserve Bluesky Page\nSubscribe to RSS\nSubscribe to Email\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\n20th Street and Constitution Avenue N.W., Washington, DC 20551", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 9015, "end_char_idx": 11418, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c448835f-8047-4d28-a1f0-17fdbe853701": {"__data__": {"id_": "c448835f-8047-4d28-a1f0-17fdbe853701", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "Agencies issue joint proposal to rescind 2023 Community Reinvestment Act final rule", "source": "Federal Reserve", "url": "https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20250716a.htm", "published_date": "2025-07-22T09:06:33.583163", "relevance_score": 10.0, "keywords": "monetary policy,interest rates,inflation,employment"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "405e15cb-1c67-47a6-ad79-d49492a0926e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"title": "Agencies issue joint proposal to rescind 2023 Community Reinvestment Act final rule", "source": "Federal Reserve", "url": "https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20250716a.htm", "published_date": "2025-07-22T09:06:33.583163", "relevance_score": 10.0, "keywords": "monetary policy,interest rates,inflation,employment"}, "hash": "a4dc25147bd5e0f22676129ba47d0db772b5e05d578bf3b6ebba22df8730d9db", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "61d76961-0f51-49fd-a453-5ef86dc74663", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "505d1c616df0c193cc0cdfb2bf7b24ba53c025b736613885bb5cdef1c9eaa923", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Agencies issue joint proposal to rescind 2023 Community Reinvestment Act final rule\n\nHere is a concise summary of the research document:\n\n**Key Market Implications:**\nThe Federal Reserve, along with other agencies, has issued a joint proposal to rescind the 2023 Community Reinvestment Act final rule. This move could have significant implications for the financial industry, particularly community banks and regional institutions.\n\n**Trading/Investment Insights:**\nThis development may lead to increased regulatory uncertainty, potentially affecting the stock prices of community-focused banks and financial institutions. Investors may want to monitor these stocks closely, as changes in regulation can impact their profitability and growth prospects.\n\n**Economic Indicators Mentioned:**\nNone specific economic indicators are mentioned in this document, but it is likely that the proposal's outcome will have implications for the broader economy, particularly with regards to community development and financial inclusion.\n\n**Risk Factors or Opportunities:**\nThe rescission of the 2023 Community Reinvestment Act final rule could create opportunities for community-focused banks and financial institutions to adapt to changing regulatory environments. However, it may also introduce uncertainty and risk for these organizations, potentially impacting their ability to lend and invest in local communities.\n\n\ufeff\nFederal Reserve Board - Agencies issue joint proposal to rescind 2023 Community Reinvestment Act final rule\nSkip to main content\nAn official website of the United States GovernmentHere's how you knowOfficial websites use .govA .gov website belongs to an official government organization in the United States.Secure .gov websites use HTTPSA lock (LockLocked padlock icon) or https:// means you've safely connected to the .gov website.

final rule issued in October 2023 and replace it with the prior CRA regulations that were originally adopted by the agencies in 1995, with certain technical amendments. If adopted, the proposal would restore certainty in the CRA framework for stakeholders in light of pending litigation and limit regulatory burden on banks, while ensuring that banks continue to serve their communities.\nBecause the 2023 final rule is subject to legal action and has not taken effect, the agencies continue to apply the 1995 regulations to banks today.\nComments on the attached proposal are due 30 days after date of publication in the Federal Register.\nFederal Register notice: Community Reinvestment Act Regulations\nComments: Submit | View\nBoard Memo on Notice of Proposed Rulemaking \u2013 Community Reinvestment Act (Regulation BB) (PDF)\nStatement from Vice Chair for Supervision Bowman\nMedia Contacts:\nFDIC\nJulianne Breitbeil\n202-898-6895\nFRB\nChelsea Grate\n202-452-2955\nOCC\nStephanie Collins\n202-649-6870\nRelated Content\nBoard Votes\nLast Update:\nJuly 18, 2025\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nAbout the FedNews & EventsMonetary PolicySupervision & RegulationFinancial StabilityPayment SystemsEconomic ResearchDataConsumers & CommunitiesConnect with the Board\nTools and Information\nContact\nPublications\nFreedom of Information (FOIA)\nOffice of Inspector General\nBudget & Performance | Audit\nNo FEAR Act\nEspa\u00f1ol\nWebsite Policies\n| Privacy Program\nAccessibility\nStay Connected\nFederal Reserve Facebook Page\nFederal Reserve Instagram Page\nFederal Reserve YouTube Page\nFederal Reserve Flickr Page\nFederal Reserve LinkedIn Page\nFederal Reserve Threads Page\nLink to Federal Reserve X Page\nLink to Federal Reserve Bluesky Page\nSubscribe to RSS\nSubscribe to Email\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\n20th Street and Constitution Avenue N.W., Washington, DC 20551", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 8966, "end_char_idx": 11179, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b5ca8410-6dfa-4a98-8e5c-28ea8b4246cf": {"__data__": {"id_": "b5ca8410-6dfa-4a98-8e5c-28ea8b4246cf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "Minutes of the Board's discount rate meetings on May 19, June 9, and June 18, 2025", "source": "Federal Reserve", "url": "https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20250715a.htm", "published_date": "2025-07-22T09:06:34.041476", "relevance_score": 10.0, "keywords": "monetary policy,interest rates,inflation,employment"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ab56d6b3-fb4a-43ad-be22-b5b8d66b7b40", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"title": "Minutes of the Board's discount rate meetings on May 19, June 9, and June 18, 2025", "source": "Federal Reserve", "url": "https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20250715a.htm", "published_date": "2025-07-22T09:06:34.041476", "relevance_score": 10.0, "keywords": "monetary policy,interest rates,inflation,employment"}, "hash": "97b6bbafb73ff9d9209ee9cd80d57a9c02074f9d8c7340bf68adff0446d15957", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ff602e87-8401-4501-a256-88ca178ad3af", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "305c4878bcfd18bd97ff283ba28c958f2fa4bdbfcbf2e2b6a4f21a8f8f16d14b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Minutes of the Board's discount rate meetings on May 19, June 9, and June 18, 2025\n\nHere is a concise summary of the Federal Reserve's minutes from their discount rate meetings on May 19, June 9, and June 18, 2025:\n\n**Key Market Implications:**\n\nThe Fed maintained its accommodative stance, keeping the discount rate unchanged.

Reserve Board\nOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency\nFor release at 1:30 p.m. EDT\nShare\nFederal bank regulatory agencies today issued a joint statement in their continued efforts to provide clarity on banks' engagement in crypto-asset-related activities. The statement highlights for banks potential risk-management considerations related to holding crypto-assets on their customers' behalf, or crypto-asset safekeeping.\nThe joint statement discusses existing risk-management principles that apply to crypto-asset safekeeping and reminds banks that provide or are considering providing safekeeping of such assets that they must do so in a safe and sound manner and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.\nThe statement does not create any new supervisory expectations.

address the \"well managed\" status of these firms\nFor release at 2:15 p.m. EDT\nShare\nThe Federal Reserve Board on Thursday requested comment on a targeted proposal to revise its supervisory rating framework for large bank holding companies to address the \"well managed\" status of these firms. The revisions would better align the supervisory rating framework with and more accurately reflect the strength of bank holding companies and the banking system as a whole. The proposal would also better align the framework with the supervisory rating systems used for other banking organizations.\nThe Board's large bank supervisory rating framework, issued in 2018, evaluates whether these banks have sufficient financial and operational strength and resilience to maintain safe-and-sound operations and comply with laws and regulations through a range of conditions. The framework includes three components: capital, liquidity, and governance and controls. Each component has four potential ratings: broadly meets expectations, conditionally meets expectations, deficient-1, or deficient-2.\nThe proposal would amend the framework by considering a bank with no more than one \"deficient-1\" rating to be \"well managed.\" Firms that do not meet this standard would be deemed not well managed and would face limitations on certain activities. Consistent with the current framework, a bank with a deficient-2 rating for any component would continue to be considered not well managed.\nThe Board is also proposing to make similar changes to its supervisory rating framework for insurers regulated by the Board.\nThe Board will evaluate additional comprehensive changes, including options to consider adding composite ratings to both frameworks, as well as changes to other supervisory rating systems.\nComments on today's proposal are due 30 days after publication in the Federal Register.\nFor media inquiries, please email [email\u00a0protected] or call 202-452-2955.\nFederal Register notice: Revisions to the Large Financial Institution Rating System and Framework for the Supervision of Insurance Organizations\nBoard memo (PDF)\nStatement from Vice Chair for Supervision Bowman\nStatement from Governor Barr\nStat", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 9580, "end_char_idx": 11924, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "09a56ae3-922c-4203-989c-f0d7b11fe86b": {"__data__": {"id_": "09a56ae3-922c-4203-989c-f0d7b11fe86b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, June 17\u201318, 2025", "source": "Federal Reserve", "url": "https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20250709a.htm", "published_date": "2025-07-22T09:06:36.877708", "relevance_score": 10.0, "keywords": "monetary policy,interest rates,inflation,employment"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "91c5324f-89c4-4d17-aa31-a881cdc243e3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"title": "Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, June 17\u201318, 2025", "source": "Federal Reserve", "url": "https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20250709a.htm", "published_date": "2025-07-22T09:06:36.877708", "relevance_score": 10.0, "keywords": "monetary policy,interest rates,inflation,employment"}, "hash": "8a47972ffc81c82e40567a4218df0af022c958969a1a2d08026e70261c593261", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "83b33e83-7005-46cd-91b6-9708b7d1938f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "305c4878bcfd18bd97ff283ba28c958f2fa4bdbfcbf2e2b6a4f21a8f8f16d14b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, June 17\u201318, 2025\n\nHere is a concise summary of the Federal Open Market Committee's minutes for June 17-18, 2025:\n\n**Key Market Implications:**\n\n* The FOMC maintained its stance on monetary policy, keeping interest rates unchanged and signaling no immediate changes.\n* The committee emphasized the need to monitor inflationary pressures and assess their impact on the economy.\n\n**Trading/Investment Insights:**\n\n* The minutes suggest that the market may be more focused on short-term rate decisions than long-term economic growth prospects.\n* Investors should continue to monitor inflation data and interest rate expectations, as any changes could impact asset prices.\n* A potential shift in monetary policy normalization could lead to increased volatility in bond markets.\n\n**Economic Indicators Mentioned:**\n\n* Inflation: The FOMC highlighted the need to monitor inflationary pressures, particularly in the context of supply chain disruptions and labor market conditions.\n* GDP growth: The committee noted that economic growth has been moderate, with some sectors experiencing stronger expansion than others.\n\n**Risk Factors or Opportunities:**\n\n* Interest rate risk: With interest rates unchanged, investors should be cautious of potential changes in short-term rates, which could impact bond yields and credit spreads.\n* Inflation risk: As the FOMC continues to monitor inflationary pressures, investors may want to consider strategies that benefit from rising prices or protect against inflationary shocks.\n* Market volatility: The minutes suggest that market participants should be prepared for increased volatility in response to changes in monetary policy or economic data.\n\n\ufeff\nFederal Reserve Board - Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, June 17\u201318, 2025\nSkip to main content\nAn official website of the United States GovernmentHere's how you knowOfficial websites use .govA .gov website belongs to an official government organization in the United States.Secure .gov websites use HTTPSA lock (LockLocked padlock icon) or https:// means you've safely connected to the .gov website.

However, it may be seen as a sign of increased regulatory scrutiny and potential for more stringent oversight in the banking industry, which could impact investor sentiment and market behavior.\n\n**Economic Indicators Mentioned:**\n\n* None explicitly mentioned in this document.\n\n**Risk Factors or Opportunities:**\n\n* The enforcement action highlights the importance of compliance with regulations and internal controls in the financial sector. This may lead to increased scrutiny on banks' risk management practices, potentially impacting their stock prices and credit ratings.\n* On the other hand, the action could also be seen as a sign of the Federal Reserve's commitment to maintaining a stable and secure financial system, which could boost investor confidence and support for the overall economy.\n\nOverall, this news is more relevant to regulatory compliance and banking sector developments rather than having direct implications for trading or investment decisions.\n\n\ufeff\nFederal Reserve Board - Federal Reserve Board issues enforcement action with former employee of Jonah Bank of Wyoming\nSkip to main content\nAn official website of the United States GovernmentHere's how you knowOfficial websites use .govA .gov website belongs to an official government organization in the United States.Secure .gov websites use HTTPSA lock (LockLocked padlock icon) or https:// means you've safely connected to the .gov website.

requirements and continuing to lend to households and businesses\n\nHere is a concise summary of the Federal Reserve Board's annual bank stress test:\n\n**Key Market Implications:**\n\nThe report suggests that large banks are well-positioned to weather a severe recession, which could lead to increased investor confidence and stability in the financial markets.\n\n**Trading/Investment Insights:**\n\nThe findings imply that investors may be more likely to take on risk and invest in assets with higher yields, as large banks are expected to maintain lending activities even in a severe recession. This could lead to opportunities for traders and investors seeking returns in fixed-income instruments or other high-yield assets.\n\n**Economic Indicators Mentioned:**\n\nThe report does not explicitly mention specific economic indicators, but the stress test results imply that the economy is likely to experience a severe recession. The absence of any significant capital shortfalls among large banks suggests that the financial system may be resilient in the face of such an event.\n\n**Risk Factors or Opportunities:**\n\nThe report highlights the potential for increased lending activities by large banks during a severe recession, which could lead to opportunities for traders and investors seeking returns in fixed-income instruments or other high-yield assets. However, it also underscores the risks associated with investing in assets that may be more sensitive to economic downturns.\n\n\ufeff\nFederal Reserve Board - Federal Reserve Board's annual bank stress test showed that large banks are well positioned to weather a severe recession, while staying above minimum capital requirements and continuing to lend to households and businesses\nSkip to main content\nAn official website of the United States GovernmentHere's how you knowOfficial websites use .govA .gov website belongs to an official government organization in the United States.Secure .gov websites use HTTPSA lock (LockLocked padlock icon) or https:// means you've safely connected to the .gov website.

recession, the aggregate decline in the common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio, which provides a cushion against losses, is 1.8 percentage points. In April, the Board proposed a rule to average stress test results over two consecutive years to reduce volatility from the stress test when calculating a firm's capital requirement. If the Board finalizes the rule as proposed, this year's results would be averaged with the 2024 results, which would lead to an aggregate capital decline of 2.3 percentage points.\nThe decrease in this year's test is smaller than the aggregate decline observed in recent years and, in part, reflects unintended volatility in the models used for the stress tests. The Board intends to address this issue when it discloses and seeks public comment on models and its scenario design framework later this year.\n\"Large banks remain well capitalized and resilient to a range of severe outcomes,\" Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle W. Bowman said. \"One way to address the excessive volatility in the stress test results and corresponding capital requirements is for the Board to finalize the proposal that would average two consecutive years of stress test results, which was released in April.\"\nAll 22 banks tested remained above their minimum CET1 capital requirements during the stress scenario, after absorbing total projected hypothetical losses of more than $550 billion.\nThis year's stress scenario is less severe than last year's scenario due to the stress test's countercyclical design. It includes a severe global recession with a 30 percent decline in commercial real estate prices and a 33 percent decline in house prices. The unemployment rate rises nearly 5.9 percentage points to a peak of 10 percent, and economic out", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 9328, "end_char_idx": 11636, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3a78fc52-ed9e-4ffe-91dd-8e1b58c5671f": {"__data__": {"id_": "3a78fc52-ed9e-4ffe-91dd-8e1b58c5671f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "Agencies request comment on proposal to modify certain regulatory capital standards", "source": "Federal Reserve", "url": "https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20250627a.htm", "published_date": "2025-07-22T09:06:38.412588", "relevance_score": 10.0, "keywords": "monetary policy,interest rates,inflation,employment"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bb1aa01c-0ba7-4736-b218-fc650d025456", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"title": "Agencies request comment on proposal to modify certain regulatory capital standards", "source": "Federal Reserve", "url": "https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20250627a.htm", "published_date": "2025-07-22T09:06:38.412588", "relevance_score": 10.0, "keywords": "monetary policy,interest rates,inflation,employment"}, "hash": "610b9b79d54effc8fb2891b67bb8db3984f3a560b37caf0e7f145722ecff1a30", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d77afa31-82b8-4c1f-8284-f04859606df1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "505d1c616df0c193cc0cdfb2bf7b24ba53c025b736613885bb5cdef1c9eaa923", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Agencies request comment on proposal to modify certain regulatory capital standards\n\nHere is a concise summary of the research document:\n\n**Key Market Implications:**\n\nThe Federal Reserve Board has proposed modifying certain regulatory capital standards, which may impact market dynamics and investor sentiment.\n\n**Trading/Investment Insights:**\n\nThis proposal could lead to changes in risk appetite, potentially affecting asset prices and volatility.

Deposit Insurance Corporation\nOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency\nFor release at 11:00 a.m. EDT\nShare\nThe federal bank regulatory agencies today requested comment on a proposal to modify certain regulatory capital standards to reduce disincentives for banking organizations to engage in lower-risk activities and promote the smooth functioning of U.S. Treasury markets.\nBanking organizations are subject to both risk-based and leverage capital requirements. Risk-based capital requirements vary based on the risks of individual exposures, imposing lower capital requirements, for example, on a Treasury security with lower risk than on a corporate bond with higher risk. Leverage capital requirements, by design, treat all exposures equally. A leverage capital requirement that is generally higher than risk-based capital requirements can discourage banking organizations from engaging in low-risk activities, such as U.S. Treasury market intermediation.\nThe proposal would modify certain leverage capital standards applicable to the largest and most systemically important banking organizations so that they serve as a backstop to risk-based capital requirements and do not discourage these banking organizations from engaging in low-risk activities. In particular, the proposal would set the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio for both bank holding companies and their depository institution subsidiaries so that it is based on a banking organization's overall systemic risk.\nThe agencies anticipate that the amount of overall capital that banking organizations maintain would generally stay the same as a result of this proposal. In aggregate, the proposal would reduce tier 1 capital standards for affected bank holding companies by less than two percent. Although certain depository institution subsidiaries could see greater reductions, that capital generally would not be available for distribution to external shareholders given the restrictions that apply at the bank holding company level.\nThe proposal would also make conforming changes to other regulations that are tied to the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio, such as total loss-absorbing capacity and long-term debt requirements.\nComments on the proposal are due by August 26, 2025.\nBoard memo (PDF)\nFederal", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 9038, "end_char_idx": 11479,
