- **✅ Realistic User Workflows**: Simulates actual user sessions with multiple interactions
- **✅ Load Testing**: Concurrent user simulation (3-10 users) with configurable duration
- **✅ WebSocket Testing**: Real-time connection and message handling
- **✅ Performance Metrics**: Response time analysis and throughput measurement
- **✅ Error Handling**: Comprehensive error scenario testing

### 2. **Frontend Browser Automation** (`qnti_browser_automation.py`)
- **✅ Complete UI Testing**: Dashboard loading, navigation, form interactions
- **✅ AI Vision Workflow**: Upload interface, dropdowns, form validation
- **✅ Trading Actions**: Parameter inputs, buy/sell buttons, watchlist functionality
- **✅ Responsive Design**: Testing across multiple screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- **✅ Accessibility**: Form labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility
- **✅ Screenshot Capture**: Visual debugging and test evidence

### 3. **Master Test Runner** (`run_qnti_full_simulation.py`)
- **✅ Orchestrated Testing**: Runs all test suites in sequence
- **✅ Performance Testing**: Multi-level load testing with detailed metrics
- **✅ Security Testing**: SQL injection, XSS, unauthorized access prevention
- **✅ Comprehensive Reporting**: Detailed JSON reports with recommendations
- **✅ Flexible Execution**: Backend-only, frontend-only, or full simulation modes

### 4. **Easy Execution Scripts**
- **✅ Windows**: `run_simulation.bat` - One-click execution
- **✅ Linux/Mac**: `run_simulation.sh` - Cross-platform compatibility
- **✅ Demo Script**: `demo_simulation.py` - Quick capability demonstration
